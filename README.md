# Robot_Muchi

This is my robotics dog project. In here you will find all the code related to this project. Currently, I am working on an AI detection system for recognizing numbers on on a scale. It first detects a video and converts it into individual frames. The python script would then loop through all of them and convert them into text. Unfortunately, I am unable to upload all of it to github due to lack of storage.

The naming protocol for videos is provided here: 

1st : O = original video 
     C= Cropped

2nd: represents it's a Motor test

3rd: O = MOV file   P = Mp4 file

4th: represent the test number.
    Ex: T1 = test 1
